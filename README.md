### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Delabove/delabove** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.




ðŸ”­ I build Wordpress E-Commerce websites for a Digital Marketing Agency and conduct site audits, SEO, and speed testing.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP.

âœ¨ I'm a developer that has come from a marketing background as a previous buisiness owner and Instructor. I fell in love with the idea of dynamic content and I have been seeking to learn development ever since. As a bootcamp grad in 2020, I've continued my education. The standards I hold myself to are at least 4-5 hours of learning per week outside of my typical 60+ hour work weeks. <br>

âœ¨ I am currently learning PHP so I can then transition over to custom theme and plugin development.
